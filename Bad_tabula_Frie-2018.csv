"Kmet’ová and Stegmann-Rajtár 2014).Whole horse bodies, and occasionally horse crania and other"
"parts of horses, have been found primarily in graves of high-status males. When the chronological"
"patterns of horse burial and horse depictions are compared (Figs. 6 and 7), it is clear that both"
"phenomena follow the same broad trends and peak c.500 BC. However, horse burials and horse"
"imagery are mutually exclusive except in a single case, Grave IV/3 at Kandija near Novo mesto,"

"phenomena follow the same broad trends and peak c.500 BC. However, horse burials and horse"
"imagery are mutually exclusive except in a single case, Grave IV/3 at Kandija near Novo mesto,"
"there are 55 graves with equine imagery and 41 horse burials that are part of the larger study sample,"
and only one grave contains both.
When these temporal patterns in horse imagery and burial are interpreted with reference to
"broader cultural developments, some possible explanations emerge. The first half of the Early Iron"
"Age, the Podzemelj and Stična periods (Fig. 8), is characterized by burials with weapons and"
"occasional burials with horses. The Stična phase was the floruit of Dolenjska Hallstatt communities,"

While horse and weapons burials from these earlier periods can be considered expressions of
"prestige, a continuation of patterns that emerged in the Late Bronze Age, it is believed that similar"
activities after 600 BC had gained new meaning. This is because the Serpentine Fibulae phase
"(600–520 BC) was a period of significant unrest that has been linked to episodic incursions of"
Scythians from the east which threw Dolenjska Hallstatt communities into a political and economic
"crisis (Dular 2007, 475–6; Dular and Tecco Hvala 2007, 251–2; Teržan 1998, 526–7; 2008, 308)."
This unrest is evident in both settlement and mortuary contexts – hillforts in north-eastern Dolenjska
"are abandoned, other hillforts have fortifications rebuilt following episodes of burning, and new,"
"small hillforts are founded in former hinterlands (Dular and Tecco Hvala 2007, 143–6, 251–2, fig."

"contain weapons (Tecco Hvala 2012, 141–2). In this period we may be seeing the democratization"
"of warrior status where larger parts of the population were armed, though the dramatic displays of"
equestrian prowess no longer maintained the same cultural currency as they did in the period when
the memory of foreign mounted warriors was still fresh. It may also be that these markers of warrior
status had become so prevalent that by the Negova Helmets period there was a loss of exclusivity in
"these elements of the male warrior panoply, and a concomitant decrease in their utility and"
"desirability for marking paramount status (Arnold 2001, 21; Miller 1982, 89; sensu Veblen 2007)."

necessitated the sacrifice of the horse upon the death of the rider as an appropriate continuation
"of their cooperative relationship from life into death (Frie 2016, 75). If this was the case, human-"
"horse burials may be analogous to the double burials of humans, where a significant interpersonal"
relationship is assumed to have necessitated the burial of two individuals in a single grave (Arnold
"and Fernández-Götz, forthcoming)."
The elite masculine ideal maintained its importance throughout the Bronze and into the
"Iron Age, and peaked in certain regions and times. In the case of Dolenjska Hallstatt society,"
equestrianism was an important component of a peak in the expression of elite masculinity in the
"transition from the sixth to fifth centuries BC. This was because the association with horses,"
"particularly riding, was an important element in the embodiment of distinction. Elite male riders"

the elite male.
The entirely novel trans-species relationship engendered by riding had significant
"repercussions for the perception of horses, as well as their riders, in local society. The ability of a"
rider to work physically in concert with a horse and extend his power over a non-human animal
"may have been viewed with awe, and may have created a sense that horses had elevated social or"
intellectual abilities. This was such a potent representational scheme because equestrianism allowed
"not simply the presentation of distinction, but the actual embodiment of distinction through"
heightened bodily powers and the extension of physical control into the animal world.
